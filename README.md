# Magic-stone
Mini game on Python (pygame)
Hello everyone My name is Bat&R. I started learning the python programming language from September 2020. So I'm new to developing programs in python. Magic stone is my third mini-game. For appreciate. Write your suggestions or comments. See you soon!
So, the game is written on the Windows 8.1 platform.
I used a program for image processing "paint.net" (v. 4.2.14), for the audio stream, the program "oceanaudio" (v.3.7.20)
I recommend the book for beginners "Al Sweigart:INVENT YOUR OWN COMPUTER GAMES WITH PYTHON, 4th EDITION"
